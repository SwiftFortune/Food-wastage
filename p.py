    ### **Sachin Hembram**  
    I hail from **West Bengal** and completed my higher secondary education at üè´**Sultanpur Vidhyamandir School**, a Bengali-medium institution. Later, I pursued my graduation at üéì**Arul Anandar College**, affiliated with **Kamraj University, Madurai**.

    Currently, I work as an üßæ**Accountant** at a school in **Uttar Pradesh**, handling financial records and ensuring smooth operations. My passion for learning has led me to explore the dynamic world of üíª **Data Science**. 

    Two months ago, I embarked on a journey with **Guvi**, enrolling in their Data Science course. While the subject initially seemed challenging, structured learning and self-study have helped me grow, and I now find the process truly enjoyable.

    I am eager to integrate my analytical skills and financial expertise with data-driven insights to contribute meaningfully in my field.
